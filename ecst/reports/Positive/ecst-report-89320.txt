Notes:
Stats 1-11 are standard statistics commonly
   reported.  #1 contains both categories completed (standard stat)
   and categories experienced, whether or not the last one was
   actually completed.  Means are computed based on categories
   experienced (not categories completed), and perseverative means
   based on categories experienced AFTER the first category usually a
   maximum of 8.  Total and percent for 1-11 are computed like the
   commonly-reported stats, to the best of our knowledge. #12,
   Perseverative runs, computes the number of error perseverations in
   a row at the beginning of each new category.
