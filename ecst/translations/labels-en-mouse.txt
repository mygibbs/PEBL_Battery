You are about to take part in an experiment in which you need to categorize cards based on the pictures appearing on them.  To begin, you will see four piles (press the mouse button to see the four piles.)
Each pile has a different number, color, and shape.  You will see a series of cards and need to determine which pile each belongs to. Click on a pile with your mouse pointer to determine the pile each new card belongs in.  The correct answer depends upon a rule, but you will not know what the rule is.  But, we will tell you on each trial whether or not you were correct. Press mouse button to continue.
Finally, the rule may change during the task, so when it does, you should figure out what the rule is as quickly as possible and change with it. Click mouse button to begin.
You may now leave.  Please alert the experimenter that you are done. Click mouse to conclude.
