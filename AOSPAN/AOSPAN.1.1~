	"the computer will automatically move you onto the next letter part," +
	"thus skipping the True or False part and will count that problem as a math error." + CR(1) +

	"as quickly and as accurately as possible." + CR(1) + CR(1)+ CR(1) +
	"click the mouse to continue.",

	"For our purposes, we can only use data where the participant was at least" +

	"Remember on the math you must work as QUICKLY and ACCURATELY as possible." +
