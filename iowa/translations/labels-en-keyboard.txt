You are about to take part in an experiment that involves gambling with play money.  You will start with a $2000 loan.  On each trial, you will select a card from one of four decks.  After you select each card, you will be given a reward and possibly be required to pay a penalty.  Your goal is to maximize the profit on your loan, and you may choose from any deck at any time to do so.   Remember that the decks are determined before the test, and your choices do not change the cards that have been put in any of te piles.  Press any key to continue.
For each card you draw, you will get a reward.  This reward depends on the deck you choose, and each deck has a fixed reward.  You will also get a penalty, which will cost you money.  Penalties are somewhat random--the penalty you will get is different for different cards in the deck.  Sometimes the penalty will be zero, and sometimes it will be larger, at times even larger than the reward you get for choosing that deck.  You should try to get as much money as possible by the end of the study.  Press any key to continue.
At the bottom of the screen, there is a graph which shows you your current earnings.  The more money you have, the larger the bar will be.                                                                                                  Now, you will begin the test.  Do you have any questions?                                                                                       Press any key to begin.
